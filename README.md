# Installation

This guide provides instructions for running the Android example app, which showcases how to implement and use Zello’s SDK functionality on Android devices. 

## Android Studio support

To use Zello’s SDK example app, you need Android Studio **Koala | 2024.1.1** or newer. Using a previous version of Android Studio Koala may prompt an error message like the following:

`The project is using an incompatible version (AGP 8.3.1) of the Android Gradle plugin. Latest supported version is AGP 8.2.1`

Please note that this example app **has not** been tested on earlier versions of Android Studio.
